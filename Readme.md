# AI_DevTeam
Imagine having a team of AI agents that can take care of most of the tasks in your software projects? Starting from requirements elicitation, over architecture design, to implementation and testing. This project is about creating such a team of AI agents that can work together on a software project. The agents have different roles and tasks, and they can communicate with each other to exchange information and delegate tasks. The project is based on the idea of multi-agent systems and aims to make a step towards autonomous software development.
